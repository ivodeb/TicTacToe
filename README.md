Tic-Tac-Toe by Ivo de Brouwer 11045841

Extra features:
- Lets the user play against the computer.
- Allows the user to choose either a two-player game or play against the computer.
- Uses large, color-coded text for crosses/circles.

Note:
- When a game has ended, you can simply click on one of the tiles to start a new game, with that tile as player 1's first move. The reset button can always be used to start a new game, even if the current game hasn't finished yet. To return to the main menu, you can press 'back' or click the 'Main menu' button.
